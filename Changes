1.28  2005-09-03
     - bump version so PAUSE ignores deleted 1.27 package

0.28  2005-08-28
     - fix version mistake in META.yml

0.27  2005-08-28
     - add method to calculate root mean square of data (suggested
       by Robert Hiller)
     - in calculating the power spectrum, use same logic for
       segments = 1 as is currently done for segments > 1 when
       "number" is specified (suggested by Robert Hiller)
     - in calculating the power spectrum, check if data size
       is an integral power of 2 if segments is not specified
       or if segments = 1 and "number" is not specified
     - in the spectrum method, change the name of the "hamm" window
       function to "hann" (suggested by Robert Hiller). For
       backwards compatibility, "hamm" is still supported.
     - in the pod for the spctrm method, clarify how options
       are to be passed in (suggested by Robert Hiller)

0.26  2004-12-04
     - include "arrays.h" in FFT.xs (required for some platforms)

     - implement the routines of arrays.c of PGPLOT to pass
       arrays to and from C
     - added methods to calculate correlation, convolution
       and deconvolution, and power spectrum
     - added some simple statistical methods

0.15  2000-12-05
      - original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
                -n Math::FFT
